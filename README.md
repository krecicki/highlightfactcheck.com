## 🎭 Pro Tips for Maximum Memery

- The more outrageous the claim, the more fun our fact-checker has. It's like giving coffee to a squirrel!
- Try typing "Elon Musk bought Twitter to tweet from Mars." Our AI might just short-circuit from the memetic overload!
- Remember, with great power comes great responsibility... to create top-tier memes based on cold, hard facts.
