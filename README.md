# X-Ray Vision for Tweet Truths: The Elon-gated Fact Stretcher Detector

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What's This Meme Machine?

This is your personal BS detector for the wild world of social media! It's like having a lie detector test for every tweet, but way more fun and slightly less awkward.

## üöÄ How to Unleash the Truth
Pre-req: Get a go to cloud.google.com and go to console and setup Google Custom Search API and the Google Fact Check API. Make a .env file and add your API keys and your custom search engine ID. https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/tutorial/creatingcse

1. **Clone this bad boy:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/X-Ray-Vision-for-Tweet-Truths.git
   ```

2. **Slide into the project directory:**
   ```
   cd X-Ray-Vision-for-Tweet-Truths
   ```

3. **Install the truth serum (dependencies):**
   ```
   pip install flask
               flask-cors
               requests
               nltk
               openai
               python-dotenv
               google-api-python-client
               duckduckgo-search
   ```

4. **Fire up the truth machine:**
   ```
   flask run
   ```

5. **Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your favorite browser (even if it's Internet Explorer, we won't judge... much).**

6. **Start typing your "facts" into the text box. Watch as our AI Elon-gates its digital muscles to fact-check your wild claims!**

7. **Click on the highlighted text to see just how far you've stretched the truth. It's like a game, but the points are made up and the facts do matter!**

## üé≠ Pro Tips for Maximum Memery

- The more outrageous the claim, the more fun our fact-checker has. It's like giving coffee to a squirrel!
- Try typing "Elon Musk bought Twitter to tweet from Mars." Our AI might just short-circuit from the memetic overload!
- Remember, with great power comes great responsibility... to create top-tier memes based on cold, hard facts.
